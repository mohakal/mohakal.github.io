        <li>B: True, Statements in Scope B have access to variables defined in Scope A.</li>
        <li>C: False, Statements in Scope B don't have access to variables defined in Scope C.</li>
        <li>D: True, Statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope A.</li>
        <li>E: True, Statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope B.</li>
